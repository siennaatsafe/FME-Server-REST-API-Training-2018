##Chapter 9- Bonus Exercise. Drive BC Road and Weather Conditions


This exercise was designed to demonstrate FME's capability to work with
other APIs. In this exercise, you will create a map and table with all
of BC's Road Warnings. This could be run regularly on your server for
constant updates. An additional feature of this could be if there was a
road warning within an area of interest, you could trigger another
notification system to run. This would notify staff of poor road
conditions.
