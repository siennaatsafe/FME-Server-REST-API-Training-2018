## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##

The following are key points to be learned from this session:

### Theory ###

- Best Practice is the act of using FME in a manner that is efficient, but also easily comprehensible by other FME users.
- Best Practice in FME can be divided into Style, Methodology, and Debugging.
- Style is a practice that makes it easier to navigate and understand an existing workspace.
- Methodology is a practice that defines the optimum transformers to use for maintenance and performance purposes.
- Debugging is the act of locating and fixing defects within a workspace.

### FME Skills ###

- The ability to use bookmarks and annotation to create a well-designed workspace style.
- The ability to create workspaces that are easier to maintain, edit, and scale.
- The ability to create workspaces that perform in an efficient manner.
- The ability to interpret an FME log file.
- The ability to inspect output and feature counts to locate errors.
- The ability to use feature debugging to trace individual features.
