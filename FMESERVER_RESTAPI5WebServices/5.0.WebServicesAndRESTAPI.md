Chapter 5- Web Services and the REST API
----------------------------------------

A Direct URL looks similar to the REST API Request URL, however it
exists outside of the REST API. To find an example of the Direct URL log
into your server and located a workspace.

Open the advanced tab and scroll down until you find the Direct URL
example:

*Image 5.0.1 Direct URL Example*

The authentication process of the Direct URL is different from the REST
API. The REST API works with tokens where Direct URLs are defaulted to
whatever permissions the guest account on your server has. If your guest
account has no permissions to run workspaces once you enter the Direct
URL you may be asked to log in. If the guest account has permission, you
may run the Direct URL without logging in.

Once you click the link your job will run and you will receive the
following notification.

*Image 5.0.2 Job Success*

Like the REST API, the Direct URL can run a job synchronously and
asynchronously. The job will automatically run synchronously. To run the
job asynchronously enter an email in the section that says Email results
to. By doing this the Direct URL will automatically be updated to run
asynchronously. Once the job has completed an email will be sent.

Just like in the REST API there are parameters you may change in the
Direct URL.

The Direct URL and REST API can be combined together in an application
to utilize the best components of both. An example is in this
demonstration:

Files are uploaded with the Direct URL, however, the job is run through
the REST API functions.
