This exercise demonstrates the transact call, which is used to run a job synchronously on the FME Server. To find more information on the Transact call visit your FME REST API page and look for the transformations section or visit https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_REST/apidoc/v3/index.html#!/transformations.   

An example of running a job synchronously would be:


    POST http://<yourServerHost>/fmerest/v3/transformations/transact/Samples/austinDownload.fmw

Notice the **transact** this indicates to the Server that you will wait
until the process is complete before receiving a result. In Postman you
will need to set up the headers section and the URL as well. Here is how
you would set up this call in Postman.

**1) Enter in the URL**

The first step is to add in the URL. Paste the URL, in the top grey area that says "Enter request URL". Then set the drop down section from *GET* to *POST*.

**2) Enter in the Headers**

In this call we have a request body, that will be in JSON. This is
displayed in the Content-Type section. Additionally, we are requesting
JSON back which is under Accept = application/JSON. The Authorization is
where you would enter your token.

    Headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
      Accept: application/json
      Authorization: fmetoken token=<yourTOKEN>

To enter in the headers required for this call. Click on the Headers tag as demonstrated below.

**3) Enter in the Body**

Next, we need to enter the body of the call. *Click on the body section
of the call* and *click on the raw button* and paste in the body provided.

    Body:
    {
     "publishedParameters": [
    {
      "name": "MAXY",
      "value": "42"
    },
    {
      "name": "THEMES",
      "value": [
        "airports",
        "cenart"
      ]
    }
    ],
    "TMDirectives": {
    "rtc": false,
    "ttc": 60,
    "description": "This is my description",
    "tag": "linux",
    "priority": 5,
    "ttl": 60
    },
    "NMDirectives": {
    "directives": [
      {
        "name": "email_to",
        "value": "example@safe.com"
      }
    ],
    "successTopics": [
      "SAMPLE_TOPIC"

    "failureTopics": []
    }
    }

You should be able to see a notice a few things. The job was run by the admin, because the token that was used belonged to the admin.

Also, you can note that the priority of the job was 5. This was set in the body of the call.

**6) Click on the Job**

The jobs page provides a more detailed description of job.

**7) Scroll down to the Jobs Log**

**8) Find the THEMES in the Log**

Simply, hit ctrl + f, to fine THEMES in the log. It should display 'airports cenart'.

So now we know that the job was completed with the requested parameters.

So, now lets update the parameters and try the call again.

**9) Locate the austinDownload Workspace in the FME Server**

On the left hand bar in the FME Server, locate the Repositories tab. Click Samples. Then click the austinDownload.fmw workspace.

**10) Find the Published Parameters for the Workspace**

Scroll down the page until you see the advanced section. Click on the plus sign, then find the published parameters. Here, we have all the parameters we can modify in the workspace. Look at the options, this time we will run the call with the railroad and streetcl options.

**11) Open Up Postman and modify the body**

If you kept Postman open simply click on the body tab again. Now change the THEMES to railroad and streetcl.
