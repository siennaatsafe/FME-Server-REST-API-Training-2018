The Transact Data call works by uploading data and running a workspace with one call to the server. It will simply run the workspace as it is and write the output to the location specified in the writer. That's good for inserting new data to a database. Once the call is completed the FME Server will return a 200 OK message. This indicates that the call was submitted successfully. However, it will not provide feedback on whether the job was completed successfully on the FME Server. It is recommended to periodically check the server to ensure your jobs are running successfully on the FME Server. Getting the status of jobs can be accomplished through the REST API as well. These calls will be displayed in Chapter 8.       

Let's start by creating a workspace that is compatible with the Transact Data call.

**1) Open the Chapter4Exercise6.Start Workspace**

 Data Source:

 <table>
 <tr>
 <td><b> Reader Format</b></td>
 <td> CSV Comma Separated Values
 </td>
 </tr>


 <tr>
 <td><b> Reader Dataset</b></td>
 <td>C:\FMEData2018\Resources\RESTAPI\Chapter4Exercise7\12656-datapoints.csv</b>
 </td>

 </tr>

 </table>

 This is a very simple workspace that reads a CSV File and produces a Shapefile.

 *Image 4.4.1 Starting workspace*

However, there is one important change that is required for this translation to work in this call. The CSV has to be an optional parameter. This is because the data will be sent in the body of the POST request to the URL and not by setting the path to the source dataset parameter in the workspace. The source dataset parameter will need to be left unset for this to work, so we need to make it optional to prevent the workspace from throwing an error about this.


**2) Set the Source Dataset Published Parameter to Optional**

This is done by right-clicking on the published parameters and selecting Edit Definition.

*Image 4.4.2 Edit a definition of a published parameter*

Then select the optional setting in the within the parameter settings.

**If you are not using a training machine you may also the Default Value to navigate your Reader Dataset**

    C:\FMEData2018\Resources\RESTAPI\Chapter4Exercise7\12656-datapoints.csv

**3) Create a folder in your FME Server for your output**

First, go to your FME Server. On the right hand side of the page locate the "Resources" and click on it. Next, click on Data. Finally, click on Create Folder and entitle it:

    RESTTraining


After we create the folder we can find the path to the folder by checking the folder. Then, go to Actions and select Properties.

*Image 4.4.4 Select the RESTTraining File then select Actions*

*Image 4.4.5 Select Properties*

**4) Update the Shapefile destination to a Shared Resource File in your FME Server**

Next, change the Shapefile to a destination within your FME Server.

To do this right click the DestDataset published parameter, then click Edit Value. Then, insert a file path to your shared resources.   

    $(FME_SHAREDRESOURCE_DATA)/RESTTraining

**5) Upload the Workspace to the FME Server**

Now, it's time to upload the workspace to your FME Server. On the top right hand corner find the Publish to FME Server button and click it.

![](./Images/image4.4.8.UploadWorkspace.png)

*Image 4.4.8 Upload the workspace*

**6) Add an FME Server Connection**

Go back to your FME Workbench. Then, under connection click, Add Web Connection.

The Server URL should be http:// followed by your  Hostname if you are on an internal network.

Otherwise, you can Google "My Public IP Address" and the first result should be a box with your public IP address. For this to work, it requires your FME Server to be made externally facing.The Server URL should be http:// followed by your IP Address if you are on a external network.

The User Name and Password should both be restapi.

Click Authenticate!


**7) Create a New Folder for Training Exercises**

Once you reach the Publish Workspace phase, under Repository click New...

Call your Repository RESTTraining

**8) Save the Workspace as Chapter4Exercise7.Complete and select the box to upload data files**

Click Next.

**10) Upload using  the Job Submitter Service**

Click Publish.

**11) Run the Workspace in your FME Server**

Now we will go to our FME Server to prove this works.

On the left hand panel we will see a Run Workspace tab.

Now select the following options:

<ul><li>Repository: RESTTraining</li>
  <li>Workspace: Chapter4Exercise7.Complete.fmw</li>
  <li>Service: Job Submitter</li>
</ul>

Now click Run!
![](./Images/image4.4.10.run.png)

*Image 4.4.10 Run the Workspace*

**12) Check that the Shapefile was successfully produced**

Go to Resources > Data > RESTTraining and ensure a Shapefile was produced.

![](./Images/image4.4.11.Resources.png)

*Image 4.4.11 Check that the Shapefile was produced*

**Delete the Shapefile**

**13) Use Postman to complete the Transact Data Call**

*Please note that this call requires authorization*

 We'll now use the call to transact data to upload a CSV file and run the workspace through the REST API.

The call is:


    POST    http://<yourSeverHost>/fmerest/v3/transformations/transactdata/RESTTraining/Chapter4Exercise7.Complete.fmw


In Postman set up the call with the following parameters:

    Authorization: fmetoken token=<yourToken>
    Accept: application/json

![](./Images/image4.4.12.Call.png)

*Image 4.4.12 Setting up the call in Postman*

The file to be uploaded will be sent in the body of the call. Click on the body tab and then the binary button. This will
give you an option to upload a file, select this file you would like to upload and run the call.

![](./Images/image4.4.13.UploadPostman.png)

*Image 4.4.13 Uploading a file in Postman*

You should receive a message 200 OK this indicates the call has
completed. Check the Jobs page in FME Server to confirm the job was correctly submitted. Also check the output location to see if the Shapefile was created.
