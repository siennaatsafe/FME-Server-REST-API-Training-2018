You've submitted an application to become an **[FME Certified Professional](https://www.safe.com/partners/certification/)**. To help you practice for the exam your colleagues have given you a number of questions to test your knowledge of searching for and selecting transformers.

Can you answer them?


<br>**1) Most-Used Web Transformers**
<br>The first thing your colleagues want to know is, what are the top five, most-used transformers in the Web category?


<br>**2) Quick Add**
<br>Here is what appears to be a list of random characters:

- lineco
- reac
- rbic
- drape
- attributeexpl
 
The second question is, which transformers are returned by Quick Add for each string, and do you know what any of them will be without trying?


<br>**3) Transformer Searching**
<br>Thirdly, your colleagues have come up with a list of different scenarios, and want you to search for a transformer to carry them out:

- We have some lines of text in a file and want to read that text and add it as an attribute.
- We have a set of vector contours and want to create a cross-section by transposing the X and Z coordinates.
- We have a point cloud dataset and want to reduce its size by resampling it to remove excess points.
- We have a text string and want to find out how many characters the string contains.
- We have a set of addresses and for each address want to find the closest two libraries.
