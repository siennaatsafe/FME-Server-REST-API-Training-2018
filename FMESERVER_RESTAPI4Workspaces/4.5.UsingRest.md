### 4.5 Using REST API Commands in a Workbench

You can use the calls you learned in this tutorial in a workspace
created. With each call you can format a new call within the REST API.
This is an excellent way to work with the REST API without any coding
experience.

There are some transformers you should be aware of before we get
started.

#### Creator

The Creator is an excellent tool for testing a workspace. It will
trigger the workspace without the need to add data.

#### HTTPCaller

The HTTPCaller is used to connect to REST APIs. It separates the call
into categories similarly to Postman. Simply enter in the Request URL,
HTTP Method, Query String Parameters, Header, and Body. The body is
broken down into several parts. You can upload data, or write the body
of the call as we have before.

#### JSONFlattener

The JSONFlattener takes the JSON responses from the FME Server and can
break down the components so they can easily be used for future calls to
the server. JSON response can be quite long so it is essential to place the response into attributes that can be used in the workspace.

#### AttributeKeeper

The HTTPCaller will produce attributes that you may use in your calls.
However, you may only wish to keep one. The AttributeKeeper acts as a
filter, it will only keep the attributes you specify.
