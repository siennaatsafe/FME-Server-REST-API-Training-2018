## Chapter 4- Interacting with Workspaces


**Please note that all calls in this section will require
authorization.**

There are two main ways a user can query the REST API. The first is
synchronously and the second is asynchronously.

A synchronous task has to be completed before the next task will begin.
The following workspace will represent a synchronous task. Running a
call synchronously is good when you need to know the results immediately
and it is a short task.

The second way is to run the job asynchronously, this will return a job
ID immediately then you can use the ID to obtain the status of the job.
Running a call asynchronously is good if you don't need an immediate
response or if it is a large task.
