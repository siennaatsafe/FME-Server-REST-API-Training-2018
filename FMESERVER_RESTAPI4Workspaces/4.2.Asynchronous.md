This exercise demonstrates the submit call, which is used to run a job asynchronously on the FME Server. To find more information on the Submit call visit your FME REST API page and look for the transformations section or visit https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_REST/apidoc/v3/index.html#!/transformations.  

If you run a job asynchronously you do not have to wait for the job to
be completed before making the next call. By running the job
asynchronously you will receive an ID back from the FME Server. You may
use this ID to call the FME Server again to get a status update on the
call.

We will run the exact same call but instead of Transact, we will change
the URL to Submit. By, submitting you will submit the job for
processing.

**1) Paste the URL below into Postman**

**Please note that all calls in this section will require
authorization.**


    **POST** http://localhost/fmerest/v3/transformations/submit/Samples/austinDownload.fmw

**2) Enter in the Headers**

  Headers:
          Content-Type: application/json
          Accept: application/json
          Authorization: fmetoken token= [INSERT TOKEN HERE]

To enter in the headers required for this call. Click on the Headers tag as demonstrated below.

**3) Enter in the Body**


Next, we need to enter the body of the call. Click on the body section of the call and click on the raw button and paste in the body provided.

        Body:
        {
         "publishedParameters": [
        {
          "name": "MAXY",
          "value": "42"
        },
        {
          "name": "THEMES",
          "value": [
            "airports",
            "cenart"
          ]
        }
        ],
        "TMDirectives": {
        "rtc": false,
        "ttc": 60,
        "description": "This is my description",
        "tag": "linux",
        "priority": 5,
        "ttl": 60
        },
        "NMDirectives": {
        "directives": [
          {
            "name": "email_to",
            "value": "example@safe.com"
          }
        ],
        "successTopics": [
          "SAMPLE_TOPIC"
        ],
        "failureTopics": []
        }
        }`

Please note that you may receive a different number back from the FME
Server. This is okay, it is just the job ID.

**6) Find the Job in your FME Server**

Open your FME Server, then click on the left hand panel of the Server where it says Jobs. Click the Job ID that matches the number you received from the FME Server.

Here, you can investigate if the job was successfully completed and what parameters were used. Here, we can see the correct features were written.
