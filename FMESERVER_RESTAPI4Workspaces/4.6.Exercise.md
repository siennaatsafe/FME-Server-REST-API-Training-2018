A very simple workspace you can create would be one that triggers
multiple workspaces in the FME Server. In this workspace, we are going
to step up a workspace to run asynchronously, wait for a response, if
the response is positive the next workspace will run. So let's begin!


![](./Images/image4.6.1.FirstStep.png)

*Image 4.6.1 First Step*

**1) Create a new File in Workbench**

**2) Add a Creator Transformer to the Page**
First, add the creator to the page. Keeping the default is okay, this will just trigger the workspace to run.

**3) Add an HTTPCaller to the Page**
Next, add the HTTPCaller. Use the Request URL to write a submit command. You may use the call below or test it out with another workspace.

There are a few different ways to authenticate with FME Server in the HTTPCaller:

1 - Use the token in the URL or header
2 - Check use authentication and set to basic authentication and enter your username and password
3 - Check use authentication and set up an FME Server Web Connection

**Please note that all calls in this section will require authorization.**

The first sections in the HTTPCaller to fill out is the Request and Headers. The layout in the HTTPCaller is very simple because all the areas to fill are clearly labelled.

Please note this is an example call which can be found here: http://localhost/fmerest/apidoc/v3/#!/transformations/submit_post_22


 Firs†, paste the Request URL in. Then, change the HTTP Method to Post. Update the Headers.


    POST http://localhost/fmerest/v3/transformations/submit/Samples/austinDownload.fmw
    Headers:
          Accept: application/json
          Authorization: fmetoken token=YOUR TOKEN


![](./Images/image4.6.2.Header.png)

*Image 4.6.2 Header and URL*

When you insert the body section of the call find **Upload Body** and
click on the dropdown menu. Click on open text editor and paste the upload body into the call.

         {
          "publishedParameters": [
            {
              "name": "MAXY",
              "value": "42"
            },
            {
              "name": "THEMES",
              "value": [
                "airports",
                "cenart"
              ]
            }
          ],
          "TMDirectives": {
            "rtc": false,
            "ttc": 60,
            "description": "This is my description",
            "tag": "linux",
            "priority": 5,
            "ttl": 60
          },
          "NMDirectives": {
            "directives": [
              {
                "name": "email_to",
                "value": "example@safe.com"
              }
            ],
            "successTopics": [
              "SAMPLE_TOPIC"
            ],
            "failureTopics": []
          }
        }



 Next, find the **Content Type** section and specify JSON (application/json). The body should look like this:


![](./Images/image4.6.2a.UploadBody.png)

*Image 4.6.2a Upload Body*

**4) Check the Output From the HTTPCaller**

Attach inspectors to the HTTPCaller and run the workspace.

The FME Data Inspector is able to read in the JSON response from the Server and produce a table with the results.  

This will provide the response from the FME Server and the HTTP Status Code.

![](./Images/image4.6.2b.DataInspector.png)

*Image 4.6.2b Data Inspector Response*

For the response body, we want to expose just the id value but disregard the JSON Formatting. Therefore, we use the JSON Flattener.

Before continuing on to the next step, delete the Inspector.


**5) Add a JSONFlattener to the Page**

Now you can add the JSONFlattener. The JSONFlattener allows you to
    select a part of the JSON to expose, in our case we should expose
    the id, so we can use it for the next call.

![](./Images/image4.6.3.JSONFlattener.png)

*Image 4.6.3 JSON Flattener Parameters*

*** Get Job Status Overview ***

![](./Images/image4.6.4.Step2.png)

*Image 4.6.4 Get Job Status.*

**6) Add an HTTPCaller**
 In this section, we are using the response from the previous call to
    determine if the call was successfully run. We will add a
    **HTTPCaller.** In the HTTPCaller, click on the drop-down menu
    next to the Request URL and click open Text Editor. Paste the
    request and for the id double-click on this icon
    ![](./Images/image4.6.4a.png) from the FME Feature Attributes
    side panel. Your call should look like this:


    GET http://localhost/fmerest/v3/transformations/jobs/id/@Value(id)


-   Now for the response in the HTTPCaller, we are going to change the
    Response Body Attribute to job\_status. So your HTTPCaller should
    look like this:

![](./Images/image4.6.5.HTTPCallerParam.png)

*Image 4.6.5 HTTP Caller Parameters*

**7) Check the Output From the HTTPCaller**

Now, attach inspectors to the HTTPCaller and view the results.

![](./Images/image4.6.5a.HTTPCallerOutput.png)

*Image 4.6.5a HTTP Caller Output*

As you can see from the above image the response is quite long in its raw form. 

**8) Add a JSON Flattener**

 Next, we need another **JSON Flattener** to expose the
\_http\_status\_code from the job\_status attribute. So, for the
input parameters under JSON Document, we are going to select
job\_status. Then under attributes to expose write \_http\_status\_code.

![](./Images/image4.6.6.JSONFlatParam.png)

*Image 4.6.6 Second JSON Flattener Parameters*

**9) Add a Tester**

-   Now we are going to add a **Tester** to determine if the workspace was successfully run. The tester should be set up like this:

![](./Images/image4.6.7.TesterParam.png)

*Image 4.6.7 Tester Parameters*

-   If the HTTP status code is 200 then the call was successful and the
    next workspace will be triggered.

Step 3. New Job is Run

**10) Add another HTTPCaller**

-   Finally, I used a third HTTPCaller to run a new job synchronously.
    To do this I used the same call that is
    [here](#running-a-synchronous-job-with-standard-parameters).

![](./Images/image4.6.8.FinalHTTP.png)

*Image 4.6.8 Final HTTP Caller*

While this is not the most practical example because we are running the
same workspace twice but in two different ways, it demonstrates how FME
can be used. It demonstrates the capabilities of running one workspace
and using the response to determine the next action.
