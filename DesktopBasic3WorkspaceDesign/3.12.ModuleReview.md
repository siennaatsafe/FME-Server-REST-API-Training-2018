# Module Review #
This session was designed to help you understand how a translation is put together, the best ways of creating it, how to read data in different ways, and how to test different sections of a workspace.

 
## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##
The following are key points to be learned from this session:

### Theory ###

- A workspace is made up of a readers, writers, and feature types. They exist in a hierarchical structure.
- Incremental development is a way of constructing a workspace, one section at a time.
- A workspace can consist of any number of readers and writers - or none at all
- FeatureReader and FeatureWriter transformers read and write data at any point in a workspace
- Integrated inspection is a set of functionality to inspect data from within FME Workbench
- Partial runs allow specified sections of a workspace to run in isolation

### FME Skills ###

- The ability to create a workspace one section at a time
- The ability to handle rejected data in a workspace
- The ability to add new readers and writers to a workspace
- The ability to use FeatureReader and FeatureWriter transformers
- The ability to read data from and write data to, web services
- The ability to inspect data using functionality in FME Workbench
- The ability to run selected sections of a workspace
