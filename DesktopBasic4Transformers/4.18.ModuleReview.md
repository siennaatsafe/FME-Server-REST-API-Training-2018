# Module Review #

This module was designed to introduce you to a wider range of FME transformers, plus a number of techniques for applying transformers more efficiently.

 
## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##

The following are key points to be learned from this session:


### Theory ###
- There are distinct groups of transformers that do work other than transforming data attributes or geometry
- Integrated editing dialogs allow the author to replace transformers with built in functions
- A large proportion of the most-used transformers are related to attribute-handling
- Filtering is the act of dividing data. Conditional filtering is the act of dividing data on the basis of a test or condition
- Data joins are carried out by transformers that merge data together, from within Workbench or from external data sources



### FME Skills ###
- The ability to locate a transformer to carry out a particular task, without knowing about that transformer in advance
- The ability to build strings and calculate arithmetic values using integrated tools
- The ability to use common transformers for attribute management
- The ability to use transformers for filtering and dividing data
- The ability to use transformers for merging data together
