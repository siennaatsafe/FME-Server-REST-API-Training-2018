### Chapter 7- Job Routing


Job routing is an important aspect of using the FME Server. Most FME
Servers have multiple engines that can be used simultaneously. Job
routing is the mechanism of directing specific jobs to specific FME
Engines. The reasons for doing this include:

-   Sending jobs to an FME Engine in close proximity to a data source.

-   Sending jobs to an FME Engine that supports a particular format.

-   Reserving an FME Engine for a scheduled task.

-   Reserving an FME Engine for quick jobs.

Job routing uses tags to assign jobs to a subset of available FME
Engines. With tags, you can associate specific jobs with certain
engines, or associate all jobs in a repository with certain engines.
