Chapter 10. Creating a Dynamically Populated Form
-------------------------------------------------
Creating a Form to Download Data.

FME has built in methods in JavaScript that allow a user to access their
FME Server when building a web application. In this exercise, you will
create a basic form, in which you will select a workspace to run. Once
you hit enter, the form will appear with the parameters populated. Once
you hit return, there will be a link to download the requested file.
