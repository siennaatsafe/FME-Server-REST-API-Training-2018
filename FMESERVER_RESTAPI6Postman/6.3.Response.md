###  6.3 Understanding the Response

-   This call is pretty advanced so you will receive a big chunk of
    JSON. This JSON would be interpreted by the Web Application and it
    would send back the correct data to the user.

-   You can explore the headers you receive back from the call. By
    hovering over the bold text Postman provides a description of the
    response header.
