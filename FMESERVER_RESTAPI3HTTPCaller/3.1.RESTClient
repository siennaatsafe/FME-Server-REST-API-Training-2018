### 3.1 Exercise- Creating a call with a REST Client Tool

The first step is to download Postman. Simply click this link
[https://www.getpostman.com/apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)
and download the app. It is available on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

### Making an HTTP Request Using Postman

Now we can make the call below using Postman.


    GET http://YOURSERVER/fmerest/v3/healthcheck?textResponse=false


This call requires no authorization and should run immediately. Notice
that there is a string query parameter in this call. This call will
automatically return a JSON response, however, you may override this by
setting the text response to true. This will return a text response
instead of JSON.

Welcome to Postman! We are now ready to make our first call to your FME
Server using the URL above. Once you open Postman you should see this
page. Click on Request.

*Image 3.2.1 Postman Interface*

From here, we receive a page to save our request. This is used if you
would like to save the call to use it in the future. Typically, the name
of the call would be much more descriptive. However, for the purposes of
this demonstration, you can come up with something creative. For this
call, you can create a new folder for training purposes.

### Interpreting the Response from Postman

Review your call. This is the response you receive.

Important Notes:

-   The response is in JSON. This is found in the header Response Header
    Content-Type.

-   In the top right-hand corner, you should see Status: 200 OK. This
    indicates it has successfully interacted with the server. This
    call required no authorization. However, most calls to the server
    do require authorization. The next step will be to make a call
    that does require authorization from the server.
