This exercise demonstrates how to make a call to the FME Server using the REST API. Postman is a REST Client Tool. REST Client Tools allow a user to enter in a Request URL and receive messages directly from the server. This exercise demonstrates the healthcheck call which will check if the FME Server is up and running properly.   

We are about to make the following call in Postman.


    GET http://<yourServerHost>/fmerest/v3/healthcheck?textResponse=false


This call requires no authorization and should run immediately. Notice
that there is a string query parameter in this call. This call will
automatically return a JSON response, however, you may override this by
setting the text response to true. This will return a text response
instead of JSON.

**1) Download Postman- If you are not already using a virtual machine**

The first step is to download Postman. Simply click this link
[https://www.getpostman.com/apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)
and download the app. It is available on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

**2) Open Postman**

Welcome to Postman! We are now ready to make our first call to your FME
Server using the URL above. Once you open Postman you should see this
page.

**3) Click on Request.**

**4) Fill in the request and click Save.**

From here, we receive a page to save our request. This is used if you
would like to save the call to use it in the future. Typically, the name
of the call would be much more descriptive. However, for the purposes of
this demonstration, you can come up with something creative. For this
call, you can create a new folder for training purposes.

**5) Copy the URL into the toolbar.**

Copy the URL into the toolbar and hit send! Notice, we are using the GET
HTTP Method for this call. To understand what this method means please
review the table in Section 1.2.  

    GET http://<yourServerHost>/fmerest/v3/healthcheck?textResponse=false

  *Please note, you will need to replace yourServerHost with localhost if you are working on a training machine*

**6) Review the response from Postman.**

Review your call. This is the response you receive.

Important Notes:

-   The response is in JSON. This is found in the header Response Header
    Content-Type.

-   In the top right-hand corner, you should see Status: 200 OK. This
    indicates it has successfully interacted with the server. This
    call required no authorization. However, most calls to the server
    do require authorization. The next step will be to make a call
    that does require authorization from the server.
