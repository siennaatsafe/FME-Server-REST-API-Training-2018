### 3.4 Creating a call without the proper Authorization:

  ---------------------------------------
  GET http://YOURSERVER/fmerest/v3/info
  ---------------------------------------

**This call should require a token to be used. This next part of the
demonstration will show you what happens when you make an unauthorized
call to the server. **

You should receive a message that says 401 Unauthorized. This is because
we have not used a token to authorized to make a call to the server. The
next part of the guide will go over how to make a request on the server
using a token.

### 3.5 Creating a call with a token

Now that we have a token we may use it in the request. Next to "GET"
paste the following URL into Postman. Replace "YOURTOKEN" with the token
you have received from the server.

  ----------------------------------------------------------
  GET http://YOURSERVER/fmerest/v3/info?fmetoken=YOURTOKEN
  ----------------------------------------------------------

You should receive the 200 response code from the FME Server. Please
note this is not the preferred method of authorization. By putting the
token into the URL it is visible and will be less secure.

The preferred method is to use the Authorization Header. To find where
to place the Authorization header, look underneath the URL find the
Headers section. In here, under key write Authorization. Then set the
value to Fmetoken token= YOUR TOKEN. The URL should be
[[http://YOURSERVER/fmerest/v3/info]{.underline}](http://sienna/fmerest/v3/info?fmetoken=e411779b3050ad777bab6f45f07d2ff5d02fbeb3).
Now try running the call.
