# Reading and Writing Workflows #

By default, the Generate Workspace dialog creates workspace with a single reader and a single writer. However, this does not mean the workspace is forever limited to this. Additionally FME can read/write data using:

- Multiple readers and/or writers
- FeatureReader and/or FeatureWriter transformers
- Integration transformers such as the DropboxConnector, Email, HTTPCaller, etc
