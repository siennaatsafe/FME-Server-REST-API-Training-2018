Chapter 3- Using a Rest Client Tool to make calls to the Server
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now that you understand what the REST API is and how the calls and
responses work; it's time to start interacting with the server.

For the purposes of this training course we will use a tool named Postman which can be downloaded here: https://www.getpostman.com/apps.

If there is another REST client tool you are familiar with you may use that as an alternative.
