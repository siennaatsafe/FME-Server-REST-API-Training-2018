Chapter 3- Using an HTTP Caller to make calls to the Server
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now that you understand what the REST API is and how the calls and
responses work; it's time to start interacting with the server.

For the purposes of this training course we will use a tool named Postman. Which can be found here: [https://www.getpostman.com/apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps).

If there is another Rest Client Tool you are familiar with you may use it as well.
