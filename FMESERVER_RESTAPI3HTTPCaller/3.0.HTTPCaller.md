Chapter 3- Using a REST Client Tool to make calls to the FME Server
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now that you understand what the REST API is and how the calls and
responses work; it's time to start interacting with the FME Server.

For the purposes of this training course we will use a tool named Postman which can be downloaded here: https://www.getpostman.com/apps.

If there is another REST client tool you are familiar with you may use that as an alternative.

#### Why use REST Client tool?

A REST Client is a medium to practice calls with. The client accepts the REST calls and will communicate directly with the FME Server. There are several reasons why a user will use a REST Client tool:

<li>Easy to use interface to input calls  </li>
<li>Save the calls and use them later </li>
<li>Can generate code snippets from the calls to use in applications</li>

I use Postman to test calls before using them in the HTTPCaller Transformer in FME Workbench. By using the REST API calls in FME Workbench I can automate many FME Server processes.
