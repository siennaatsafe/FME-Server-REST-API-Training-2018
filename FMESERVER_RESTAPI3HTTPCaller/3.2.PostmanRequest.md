### 3.2 Making an HTTP Request Using Postman

Now we can make the call below using Postman.


    GET http://YOURSERVER/fmerest/v3/healthcheck?textResponse=false


This call requires no authorization and should run immediately. Notice
that there is a string query parameter in this call. This call will
automatically return a JSON response, however, you may override this by
setting the text response to true. This will return a text response
instead of JSON.

Welcome to Postman! We are now ready to make our first call to your FME
Server using the URL above. Once you open Postman you should see this
page. Click on Request.

From here, we receive a page to save our request. This is used if you
would like to save the call to use it in the future. Typically, the name
of the call would be much more descriptive. However, for the purposes of
this demonstration, you can come up with something creative. For this
call, you can create a new folder for training purposes.
