The response structure is very similar to the request structure. This
features the response body, response code, and the response header.

Most calls to the FME Server will result in a response. This is what

you may automate another process to run. The body of the Response Body
will always be in JSON.

**Response Code**

The request above should result in a code 200 which is outlined in the
example call:
