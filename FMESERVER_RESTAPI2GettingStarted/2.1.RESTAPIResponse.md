### 2.1 Understanding the REST API Response.

The response structure is very similar to the request structure. This
features the response body, response code, and the response header.

**Response Body**

*Image 2.2.1 Response Body*

Most calls to the FME Server will result in a response. This is what
makes the FME Server REST API a very powerful tool. With this response,
you may automate another process to run. The body of the Response Body
will always be in JSON.

**Response Code**

The request above should result in a code 200 which is outlined in the
example call:
